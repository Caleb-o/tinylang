# Note: All variables will bind to their type
# eg. var a = 10; a is now an integer and can 
# only be reassigned with other integers

# Mutable string value
var hello = "Hello, World!";
print(hello);

hello = "Hello, Me!";
print(hello);

# Immutable integer value
let age = 22;
print("I am ", age, " years old!");

# Declare multiple variables at once
let a = 10, b = 20;
print(a, " ", b);
